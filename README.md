# Airports Data Analysis
We have been tasked to uncover potential patterns in the data to help the client decide which airports to avoid for future travel. While the conducted analysis so far has been relatively shallow, the data itself has proved its value solely through its immense breadth in potential insights. Two notable routes include the construction of interactive dashboards, and the integration of external datasets (in this case, obtained from web scraping). Deeper dives into this data is highly recommended.
## Google Colaboratory version
To promote accessibility and convenience, the three notebooks have also been adapted to a Google Colab environment.
